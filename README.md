# Simple Repo Fetching React App

Lets you fetch and filter Github repos.
May not work that well, let me know where I can improve.

Github Search API only returns 1000 entries.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


Available Scripts

`npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
